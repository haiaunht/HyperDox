For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification |taxonomy.dox:| of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago) from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant ursids. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.
Despite the shared name, habitat type |behavior.dox:|, and diet |diet.dox:|, as well as a unique enlarged bone called the pseudo thumb |description.dox:pseudothumb| (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and red panda are only distantly related |subspecies.dox:5|.
