For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda |top.dox:panda| was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago) from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant ursids. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil. 
Despite the shared name, habitat type, and diet, as well as a unique enlarged bone called the pseudo thumb |#pseudothumb| (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and red panda |subspecies.dox:5| are only distantly related.
