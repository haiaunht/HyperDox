The giant panda has luxuriant black and white fur. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 meters (4 to 6 feet) long, including a tail of about 10 to 15 centimeters (3.9 to 5.9 inches), and 60 to 90 centimeters (2.0 to 3.0 feet) tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kilograms (350 pounds). Females (generally 10 to 20% smaller than males) can weigh as little as 70 kilograms (150 pounds), but can also weigh up to 125 kilograms (276 pounds). Average adult weight is 100 to 115 kilograms (220 to 254 pounds).
The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat. The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45 kilograms (243.5 pounds) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5 kilograms (259 pounds) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.
The giant panda's paw has a "thumb" and five fingers; the "thumb" |#pseudothumb|, actually a modified sesamoid bone, helps it to hold bamboo while eating. Stephen Jay Gould discusses this feature in his book of essays on evolution and biology, The Panda's Thumb |earlyreferences.dox:|. 
The giant panda's tail, measuring 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches), is the second longest in the bear family. The longest belongs to the sloth bear.
The giant panda typically lives around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity. A female named Jia Jia was the oldest giant panda ever in captivity, born in 1978 and died at an age of 38 on 16 October 2016.
