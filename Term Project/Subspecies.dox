The Qinling panda has a light-brown and white pattern
Two subspecies of giant panda |top.dox:panda| have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, color patterns, and population genetics.
The nominate subspecies Ailuropoda m. melanoleuca consists of most extant populations of panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colors.
The Qinling panda, A. m. qinlingensis is restricted to the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of 1300 to 3000 meters. The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant pandas is replaced with a dark brown versus light brown pattern. The skull of A. m. qinlingensis is smaller than its relatives, and it has larger molars.
A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinlin population occurred about 300000 years ago, and reveals that the non Qinlin population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai Daxiangling Xiaoxiangling Liangshan group respectively, about 2800 years ago.
