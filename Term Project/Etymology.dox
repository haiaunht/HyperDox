The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda |subspecies.dox:|, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda. Until 1901, when it was erroneously stated to be related to the red panda |subspecies.dox:5|, the giant panda was known as "black and white cat-footed animal" (Ailuropus melanoleucus).
In many older encyclopedic sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" originally referred to the lesser known red panda, thus necessitating the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser red" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013 the Encyclopedia Britannica still used "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear, and simply "panda" for the Ailuridae, despite the popular usage of the word "panda". 
Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as huaxiong ("spotted bear") and zhuxiong ("bamboo bear"). The most popular names in China today is daxiongmao (literally "giant bear cat"), or simply xiongmao ("bear cat"). The name xiongmao ("bear cat") was originally used to describe the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), but since giant panda was thought to be closely related to red panda, daxiongmao was named relatively.
In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted damaoxiong ("giant cat bear"), though many encyclopediae and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the "bear cat" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, "bear" instead of "cat" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which may have led to the popular choice despite official writings. This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.
