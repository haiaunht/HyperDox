Pandas |top.dox:panda| have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.
Chi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol.
A 2006 New York Times article outlined the economics of keeping pandas |diet.dox:|, which costs five times more than that of the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million |diplomacy.dox:| a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost.  The last contract, with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.
